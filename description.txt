Project Title: Numerical Analysis of Coupled Pendulums: A Hierarchy of Complexity1. Project ObjectiveThe goal is to simulate the motion of two pendulums ($m_1, m_2$) of length $\ell$ connected by a spring ($k$) with a rest length of $\ell/2$. We will investigate how the system's behavior changes when subjected to a high-velocity "push" across three levels of mathematical modeling.2. Physical Setup & ParametersMasses: $m_1$ (pushed), $m_2$ (initially at rest).Pendulum Length: $\ell$.Spring: Constant $k$, rest length $L_0 = \ell/2$.Initial Conditions: $\theta_1 = \theta_2 = 0$, $\dot{\theta}_1 = v_0/\ell$, $\dot{\theta}_2 = 0$.3. The Three Models (Complexity Levels)Level 1: The Small-Angle (Linear) ModelThis model assumes $\sin\theta \approx \theta$ and that the spring only moves horizontally.Equation of Motion:$$\ddot{\theta}_1 = -\frac{g}{\ell}\theta_1 + \frac{k}{m_1}(\theta_2 - \theta_1)$$$$\ddot{\theta}_2 = -\frac{g}{\ell}\theta_2 - \frac{k}{m_2}(\theta_2 - \theta_1)$$Expectation: Perfect periodic energy transfer (beating). The amplitude will be unrealistically linear.Level 2: The Semi-Nonlinear ModelWe restore the gravitational non-linearity but keep the spring "flat" (assuming it only stretches based on horizontal distance).Equation of Motion:$$\ddot{\theta}_1 = -\frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta_1 + \frac{k}{m_1}(\sin\theta_2 - \sin\theta_1)\cos\theta_1$$$$\ddot{\theta}_2 = -\frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta_2 - \frac{k}{m_2}(\sin\theta_2 - \sin\theta_1)\cos\theta_2$$Expectation: The period will increase with amplitude. Energy transfer is still mostly periodic but frequency-shifted.Level 3: The Fully Nonlinear (Exact) ModelThe spring length $d$ is calculated using the full 2D Euclidean distance between the masses.Coordinates: $(x_i, y_i) = (\ell\sin\theta_i, -\ell\cos\theta_i)$.Spring Stretch: $\Delta d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1+\ell/2)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} - L_0$.Expectation: At "huge" velocities, this model may exhibit chaotic behavior. The vertical displacement of the masses will create complex spring torques that the other models ignore.4. MATLAB Implementation StrategyYou should use the State-Space Representation to solve these in MATLAB using ode45 or ode113.Define State Vector: $Y = [\theta_1, \dot{\theta}_1, \theta_2, \dot{\theta}_2]^T$.ODE Function: Create a function dY = coupledPendulums(t, Y, params, complexity) that switches between the three logic levels.Solver: Use [t, Y] = ode45(@(t, Y) coupledPendulums(t, Y, p, 3), tspan, Y0);.Mass Variation: Run simulations for $m_1 = m_2$ and $m_1 \gg m_2$ to observe "Master-Slave" dynamics.5. Visualization & AnalysisTo fulfill the project requirements, you will generate the following plots:Time Series: Plot $\theta_1(t)$ and $\theta_2(t)$ to show the "beating" and energy transfer.Phase Portraits: Plot $\dot{\theta}$ vs $\theta$ for each mass. Look for the transition from ellipses (Model 1) to complex "webs" or rotations (Model 3).Configuration Space: Plot $\theta_1$ vs $\theta_2$. In the linear case, this forms a Lissajous pattern; in the chaotic case, it fills the space.Energy Conservation: Plot $E_{total} = T + V$ over time to ensure your numerical solver isn't "leaking" energy.6. Key Comparison PointsWhen you write your final report, focus on:The Divergence Point: At what initial velocity $v_0$ do the predictions of Model 1 and Model 3 differ by more than 10%?Symmetry Breaking: How does changing the mass ratio $m_1/m_2$ affect the energy transfer efficiency?The "Over-the-Top" Case: If $v_0$ is high enough for $360^\circ$ rotation, show how Model 1 fails completely (it will just show a massive amplitude oscillation) while Model 3 shows a continuous rotation in phase space.
